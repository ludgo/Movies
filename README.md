# Movies

This is a fully educational Android application based on free course materials at Udacity platform. The aim is to provide users with various movie charts fetched from themoviedb.org API.

## Dependencies

- Picasso `com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.5.2`

For development, the newest Android SDK was used. Nowdays, the application is not mantained up to date with the latest Android platform changes.

## Motivation

The ultimate goal was to create my very first Android application including activities, fragments, services, adapters, SQLite database, content provider and master-detail view. See Udacity's [instructions page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlN1fUsCSKuInLECcJkslIqvpKlP7jWL2TP9m6UiA6I/pub?embedded=true#h.y4qfj5ptq2cv).

## UX

Users basically can:

- Browse movies in grid sorted by actual preference
- View each movie in detail, involving corresponding video trailer links and user reviews
- Save movie to favorites to keep it for later
- Change general settings like theme color, movies' release year etc.
